## Credit & License

* This project is inspired by [plummm/alfred3-workflow-CurrencyX](https://github.com/plummm/alfred3-workflow-CurrencyX)

  I made this spin-off because the original one doesn't work in the way I thought it should be. As I'm trying to tweaking the the old ones, things get more out of control which ended up me deciding to re-write my own version.

* Core Library depends on the work-of-art-library [deanishe/alfred-workflow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow)

* API provided by [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/)
