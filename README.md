# Coon

Coon is an Alfred workflow which do currency conversion by using live currency rates from Open Exchange Rates API.

For list of support currencies, Installation, Setup and Usage, see [Wiki](../../wiki)

# Name Change

I name this workflow with an online business name generator, with no background acknowledge or concept of the naming.

My thoughts are simple, "con-" for "conversion", a mistype of "coin", and a same pronunciation "coneüç¶" with a food I'm in favor.

However, after the terrible, horrifing tragedy happened recently, this name is abandoned, and will be updated recently.

My sincerly apologize for any unconfort that might arouse. #BlackLivesMattters

  I made this spin-off because the original one doesn't work in the way I thought it should be. As I'm trying to tweaking the the old ones, things get more out of control which ended up me deciding to re-write my own version.
